<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: Read About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify">
  This repo is the source of the Matsumoto House website/platform. The Matsumoto House is a website for current Turing Students and Alumni who have been assigned to the Matsumoto House. The goal of this project is to create an OpenSource platform that embellishes and encourages growth, collaboration and successful transition to a career in software development. The Houses of Turing exists as a way to encourage interaction/collaboration across time and space. We are the first House to establish an online presence, so obviously we're the best of all the Houses (clearly this is said in jest, please take it lightly).

<!-- PREREQUISITES -->
<h2 id="prerequisites"> :fork_and_knife: Make sure you meet the Prerequisites before going further</h2>

[![made-with-ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/made_with-ruby-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby)](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)<br>
[![made-with-rails](https://img.shields.io/badge/made_with-rails-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=rubyonrails)](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

<!--This project is written in Python programming language. <br>-->

The following software versions used in this project:

- Ruby 3.2.4 (as of 8/17/2024)
- Rails 7.1.3 (as of 8/17/2024)

If you do not have this version of Ruby on your machine, you'll need to install it. Once the new version of Ruby is installed, you'll need to install a new instance of Rails for that version of Ruby. Detailed instructions can be found [here](/docs/installing-new-versions.md)

<!-- * Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn
* Scikit-tda

<!-- Clone the rep0 -->
<h2 id="clone-the-repo"> :scroll: Clone the repo</h2>

<p>Now that your local machine has the correct version of Ruby and Rails, let's get the project on your local machine.</p>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MarchandMD/matsumoto_house.git

```

Then, of course, `cd` into the project

```bash
cd matsumoto_house
```

<!-- start it locally -->
<h2 id="start-it-locally"> :scroll: Start it locally</h2>

<p>it can run with the usual `rails s`</p>

However, if you'd like to be able to use VSCode's built in debugger you can open this with:


```bash
bin/dev
```

Additional details about using the the `debug` gem (which is the default in rails 7) instead of pry with VSCode's built-in debugging environment, there will be docs [here](/docs/debugging-in-rails-with-vscode.md)

<h2 id="code-of-conduct"> :scroll: Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>This is an Open Source project, that we're hoping grows to become a great project that people enjoy contributing to. With that said, there's a lot of "mystery" surrounding what an actual job in software development might be like. Working in this project is a great way to begin to see just what it is like, specifically when it comes to submitting PRs, reviewing PRs, and ultimately approving PRs.</p>
<p>Certain rules are in place for Continuous Integration, as well as guardrails for PR merges to follow certain standards.</p>
<p>Anyone reviewing a PR is free to make any comments they'd like regarding a PR. Though any comment made on a PR is a suggestion. If the writer of the code has a justifiable, reasonable explanation for how they wrote something, then we encourage a healthy dialogue. We strongly encourage pair programming, mob programming or other collaboration in real time so everyone's voice can be heard.</p>
